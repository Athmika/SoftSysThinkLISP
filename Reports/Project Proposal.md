															Lisp Interpreter

**Goal of our project**: 
Out MVP for this project is to create a minimal lisp interpreter in C.

 Our MVP should be able to accurately carryout all comparison and numerical lisp operations.  For example, (+ 1 2 3) should evaluate to 6,  (- -3) should evaluate to 3,  (= 11 11) should evaluate to true,  (> 1 11) should evaluate to false and so on.
The interpreter should read and store variables. For example, (setq y 5) should set the value 5 to the variable y. 
 Our MVP should also be able to evaluate conditional expressions that take this form: (if (condition) (action1) (action2)). 

Out stretch goal is to include additional lisp functionality like processing loops and handling logical operations.  

**Learning goals**: 
We hope to get more comfortable with C syntax and C coding practices. We want to explore how an interpreted language like lisp functions on a system level in comparison with C  And as we work on this project, we also hope to develop good practices for coding in a team, that includes maintaining an up to date trello and using GitHub effectively. 

**Resources**: 
We plan on using online resources that include:

Tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lisp/index.htm
Build your own Lisp book: http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents
Blog on how to create a Lisp interpreter: http://leohetsch.com/create-a-minimal-lisp-like-interpreter-in-c/
Geeks For Geeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

We also plan on attending Ninja Hours regularly and consulting our Ninjas for help with understanding C. 

**First Steps**:
*STEP-1*:  Understand how Lisp expressions function. We consider this step done when we can come up up at least 15 test cases that can thoroughly demonstrate the working of our MVP. Assigned to: Athmika

*STEP-2*: Read through the first chapter of ‘Build your own Lisp’. We can consider this done, when we discuss topics from the first chapter at a team meeting.

*STEP-3*: Implement one numerical operator. We can consider this done when an input like (+ 1 2) works.
